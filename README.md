# hackmud-sim.py

A scripting environment (built using Python) for the video game `hackmud`, released by Drizzly Bear in 2016, currently owned by COMCODE.

## Current state of the project:

At the moment, despite releasing this publicly, `dayofni/hackmud_sim` is ultimately a passion project.
I'd prefer to work on it myself, given an option, but I certainly wouldn't mind a second (or third, or fourth...) pair of eyes to help catch bugs and such.
Because of this, until it's done, I'd prefer to work on major features alone, if that's alright.
If this changes, I will change this message, and the code will be completely open to editing.

### Finished features:

- A locally hosted MongoDB accurate to the game.
- A working colour-syntax highlighting script (that could use a little more work).

### TODO:

- Recreate the scripting environment of the game to the best of my ability
- ...profit?
